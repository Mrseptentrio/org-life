Today, my splendid wife and me, went to her parent house with syrian food, we then came back home, had a little fun, i then started setting up an Ubuntu VM to develop, i installed doom emacs, and started playing around with org mode, especially the captur and the journal functionality,let it be the first of many.

Today was actually a productive day, my significant other and I went to my school to take back my corrected master's degree, then off to her parents house for some greetings,
then, to a traductor, our diplomas needs to be in english in order to send them to the WES organisation and have the equivalent internationally recognized;
Other than that, I am still advancing on the Odin Project, learning emacs through doom emacs and trying to get of grasp of org and the todo's and journaling functonality on it.
